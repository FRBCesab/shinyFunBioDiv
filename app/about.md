The aim of this dashboard is to explore the metadata of the FunBioDiv datasets. You can select the dataset based on **agricultural practices** and/or **response variables**.

### Agricultural practices

Diversification measures used for the experimental design in primary studies, i.e. used as a structuring variable for the experimental design.


| Name             | Description                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `service_plant`    | Service plant                                          |
| `cultivar_mixture` | Cultivar mixture                                       |
| `intercropping`    | Intercropping                                          |
| `cover_crop`      | Cover crop                                             |
| `agroforestry`     | Agroforestry                                           |
| `crop_rotation`    | Crop rotation at the field scale                       |
| `natural_habitats` | Amount of semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale |
| `crop_diversity`   | Crop diversity at the landscape scale                  |



### Response variables

There are four types of response variables that could possibly be collected.


| Name             | Description                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Pest`             | Pest type (pest/weed/ pathogen abundance or frequency) |
| `NE`               | Natural Enemies (community data on different groups)   |
| `P. control`       | Pest control potential (predation rates by sentinel cards or exclusion cages) |
| `Other`            | Other                                                  |




## About Funbiodiv


The [**FunBioDiv** project](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/funbiodiv/) assesses the impact of combining plant diversification strategies at different spatial and temporal scales on biodiversity and the control of crop pests.  

The research project **FunBioDiv** was selected from the [2023 FRB-MTE-OFB "Antropogenic pressures and impacts on terrestrial biodiversity](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/calls/appel-a-projets-frb-mte-ofb-2023-pressions-anthropiques-et-impacts-sur-la-biodiversite-terrestre/).
